\chapter{Appendix}

The appendix includes additional materials that support your main text.

In this appendix, you can provide detailed information, data, figures, or other relevant materials that are not essential for the main body of the thesis but may be useful for readers who want to delve deeper into specific aspects of your research.

Ensure that the content in the appendix is well-organized and labeled clearly. Refer to the appendix in the main text when necessary, so readers know where to find supplementary information.

Remember that the appendix should be optional, and the main text should be self-contained and able to stand alone without requiring reference to the appendix.
