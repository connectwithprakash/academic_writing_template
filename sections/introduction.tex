\chapter{Introduction}

The introduction serves to introduce the thesis topic, provide background information, and state the research question and objectives.

Your introduction should provide context, highlight the significance of the research topic, and set the stage for the rest of the thesis. Start by introducing the general field of study and gradually narrow down to your specific research question. Clearly state the objectives and scope of your research.

The introduction should engage readers, making them interested in the topic and eager to learn more about your research. Provide enough background information to help readers understand the context and importance of your work.

In the last section of the introduction, provide an overview of how the rest of the thesis is structured. Briefly describe what each chapter or section will cover, creating a roadmap for your readers.
