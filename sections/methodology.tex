\chapter{Methodology}

The methodology explains your research design, data collection methods, and procedures used in the study.

Your methodology should provide a detailed account of how you conducted your research, allowing other researchers to replicate your study. Start by describing your overall research approach (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods). Then, explain the specific methods and techniques you used to collect data (e.g., surveys, interviews, experiments).

Provide a rationale for your methodological choices. Explain why these methods were suitable for addressing your research questions and how they contribute to the validity and reliability of your findings.

Discuss any limitations or potential biases in your methodology and describe the steps you took to minimize these issues.

In the next section, describe the procedures you followed during data collection and data analysis. Provide a step-by-step account of how you collected and processed your data and the tools you used for analysis.

The methodology chapter should be comprehensive and transparent, allowing readers to assess the quality and rigor of your research.
